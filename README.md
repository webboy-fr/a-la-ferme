# Project - Ma Ferme Locale

Within the framework of our training, Valentin HUARD and myself, Maud LEFORT, wish to create a project allowing both to learn and use two frameworks in a project and to answer a problem. Indeed, when we want to get local products from producers, we often lack information and resources to help these producers. To solve this problem, we want to create a site that would allow us to know around us the farms, farmers and producers who offer the sale of local products. Of course, a group of farmers can be present and offer their products individually or in groups.

The purpose of this site is to easily access the details of sales of local products of a farmer with :

- Information about the farmer / the group of farmers
- GPS coordinates of the place of sale
- Opening and closing hours of the place of sale
- Products sold
- Label (biologics products, AOP products etc.)

Each farmer / group of farmers can modify the information concerning them by having access to a dedicated Back Office.

This project allows to highlight local products, farmers, their jobs, their passions and to have an exchange between consumers and producers.
